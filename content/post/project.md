# Literature Review 

In literature review, we have done our topic on the following area to enhance our preliminary knowledge: 

## Plotting a colored Taiwan Map based on population: 

This is a simple project where the author analyzes Taiwan population distribution on a choropleth map. There are many insights we gain from this project such as how we should process the data. For example, not all files have an English version, this project show how we can join the data even if they are in different languages.

## Spatial Distribution analysis of convenience store in Kaifeng (China): 

This project focuses on the spatial distribution of convenience store in Kaifeng city and how it will affect the retail industry. Their research analyzes the spatial layout characteristics of convenience store such as traffic and compare the spatial distribution of convenience store with population clusters. They discovered that there is sufficient service coverage, unbalanced spatial distribution based on population cluster and most convenience store are distributed in cheaper land price area. Hence, they have come out with several recommendation for government to provide a uniform service range of comprehensive coverage.

# Methodology 


* Create a R Shiny application that allow us to view the location of 7-11 and its relations with other amenities.  

* To perform spatial point pattern analysis on 7-11 in Taiwan 

* Choropleth Map to visualize the population in Taiwan 

* Kernel Density Estimation of 7-11 and other amenities in Taiwan 

* Auto-correlation with 7-11 stores and various amenities 

* Second Order Analysis such G-function and L-function
