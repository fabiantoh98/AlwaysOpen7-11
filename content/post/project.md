## Plotting a colored Taiwan Map based on population: 

This is a simple project where the author analyzes Taiwan population distribution on a choropleth map. There are many insights we gain from this project such as how we should process the data. For example, not all files have an English version, this project show how we can join the data even if they are in different languages.
