# Project Motivation

Convenience stores are a huge deal in Taiwan. Especially the Japanese-American chain, 7-Eleven is ubiquitous in Taiwan with 5,000 over stores distributed around the country. It provides various services that help people with their daily activities such as bill payment, cash withdrawal, top-up, delivery and pickup parcels. With that, the 7-11 in Taiwan plays an important part in peoples’ daily lives. It has also been integrated in peoples’ modern part of life by delivering brilliance service with every visit unlike the 7-11 in Singapore where people visit only when there is no other alternative. Therefore, this project aims to leverage on geospatial methods to discover the characteristic of 7-Eleven locations in Taiwan.
